instantaneous reproduction number: |
  The effective reproductive number, denoted as $R_e$ or $R(t)$, is the expected number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in a population where some individuals may no longer be susceptible.

  'quantitative reflection of the magnitude of some phenomenon that is used for the purpose of addressing a question of interest' (Kelley & Preacher, 2012)

power: |
  The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, for a specific analysis, effect size, sample size, and criteria for significance.

SESOI: |
  Smallest Effect Size of Interest: the smallest effect that is theoretically or practically meaningful

  See [Equivalence Testing for Psychological Research](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918770963) for a tutorial on methods for choosing an SESOI.
