### Description
<div style="font-size:0.8em">Copied from the developer site<br><br></div>

[APEestim](package_APEestim.qmd) estimates the time-varying reproduction number on cases by date of infection (using a similar approach to that implemented in [EpiEstim](package_EpiEstim.qmd)).

The quality of this estimate is highly dependent on the size of a smoothing window (k) that is employed. This code presents a method for optimally selecting k in a manner that balances reliable R(t) estimation with short-term forecasts of incidence. This method is based on the accumulated prediction error (APE) idea from information theory.

### Methods

This package aims to improve upon the limitation of [fixed sliding windows](methods_time.qmd#sec-fixedwindow), specifically by optimizing the choice of the window size in an [APE Framework](methods_time.qmd#sec-ape).
