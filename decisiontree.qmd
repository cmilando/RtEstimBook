# Decision matrix {#sec-top .unnumbered}

You can use the decision tool below to help choose which R packages may be right for your application:

1. Look first for the desired output that you want to produce
1. Then see which set of required data you have. If you do not have the required data for a specific package, use a different one
1. Finally, estimate $R(t)$ using the packages that are appropriate for your use case

<small>See below the table for the assessment framework used to decide which packages to recommend.</small>

::: {.callout-important}
## Strong recommendation
**Use multiple packages** in your analysis; an ensemble of approaches will be the best way to ensure a robust estimate of $R(t)$ for your use case.

### Assessment framework {#sec-assessment}

An evaluative comparison of the performance of the methods in these packages would be highly complex, given the following challenges:

- Some of the most widely-used packages are not accompanied with a peer-reviewed manuscript that describes or evaluates the theory behind modeling choices. 
- Each package contains a subset of the methods below for constraining $R(t)$ in time, but with subtle variations in implementation that are often not well-documented. 
- Some packages have not been recently updated, and even those that have are not maintained on CRAN, instead leaving updates on a development version on GitHub. 
- Performance may vary widely considering additional factors like ease of implementation and computational time.

Instead, we focus on a simple Huerstic
