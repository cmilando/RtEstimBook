### Brief description
<div style="font-size:0.8em">Copied from the developer site<br><br></div>

Maximally informed, mean square error optimised estimates of reproduction numbers (R) over time.

Uses Bayesian recursive filtering and smoothing to maximise the information extracted from the incidence data used. Takes a forward-backward approach and provides estimates that combine advantages of [EpiEstim](package_EpiEstim.qmd) and the Wallinga-Teunis method. Method is exact (and optimal given a grid over R) and deterministic (produces the same answer on the same data).

### Methods

This package contains the following methods to solve for $R(t)$ in time:

- [filtering](methods_time.qmd#sec-filtering)
