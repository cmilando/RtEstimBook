    "text": "Preface\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, there has been a proliferation of software packages that make inference about the current state of an infectious disease outbreak based on daily counts of disease cases. An important and widely used parameter is the instantaneous or effective reproduction number, R(t), defined in Gostic et. al. (2020) 1 as follows:\n“The effective reproductive number, denoted as Re or Rt, is the expected number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in a population where some individuals may no longer be susceptible.”\nDefined as such, R(t) is an unobserved quantity that captures the aggregated combination of disease characteristics (e.g., infectiousness under controlled conditions, mode of transport) and extrinsic factors (e.g., lockdowns that reduce person-to-person contact). An R(t) = 1 indicates a “stable” epidemic at time t, where each infected person infects on average one additional person; R(t) values above or below 1 represent a growing or a shrinking epidemic respectively. We focus on R(t) given its relevance for time-sensitive decision-making, and summarize the currently used inputs, data, methods and assumptions in R(t) estimation across the following categories:\n\nHow the relationship between R(t) and infections is defined\nHow R(t) is constrained using distributions for key variables\nHow R(t) is constrained over time\nAdditional data and distributions that are used to constrain R(t)\nInference frameworks that are used to estimate R(t) ** is constrained the right word?\n\nIn this paper we provide a theoretical comparison of the current field of methods for estimating R(t), with the goal of informing user decision-making about which package to choose and in interpreting package outputs. For reference, Table 1 lists packages with an accompanying peer-reviewed journal manuscript, Table 2 lists packages without a peer-reviewed journal manuscript, and Table S1 contains R(t) packages that calculate R(t) but were excluded from this summary. In the text, the package citation is given the first time each package is referenced.\nWe limit the methods discussed here to those for estimating historical to present-day R(t) values using daily case count data, where a case can be flexibly defined as an individual with a reported positive test (either through healthcare-seeking behavior, routine surveillance, or a hospital admission). Other methods not discussed here include inference of R(t) exclusively from alternative data sources (e.g., genetic data,2 behavioral data,3 or viral loads in waste-water4), or calculations from compartmental, agent-based models, or network.5–7 We also limit the discussion to packages in the statistical software R,8 which may exclude some packages in other software programs that combine many of the methodological considerations discussed below.9 We do not discuss any packages for now-casting or forecasting, though a number of R(t) estimation packages can be used for this purpose. The methods discussed below and references to specific R packages are current as of December 1, 2024. We attempt to harmonize the mathematical choices between each package using terminology from each.\nAn evaluative comparison of the performance of these methods would be highly complex, given the following challenges. Some of the most widely-used packages are not accompanied with a peer-reviewed manuscript that describes or evaluates the theory behind modeling choices. Each package contains a subset of the methods below for constraining R(t) in time, but with subtle variations in implementation that are often not well-documented. Most packages have not been recently updated, and even those that have are not maintained on CRAN, instead leaving updates on a development version on GitHub. The combination of differing model frameworks associated with each package make it challenging to easily compare the impacts on estimated R(t), especially when considering additional factors like ease of implementation and computational time",

    "text": "A straightforward method of imposing structure on R(t) over time involves constraining R(t) to be drawn from the same distribution within moving time subsets, called sliding windows. We add the prefix of “fixed-size” to distinguish from methods that may adapt the size of the sliding window over time. &gt;&gt; make a destinction between deriving it and doing it by Bayesian.\nConsider the scenario where I(t) are drawn from a series of Poisson distributions and where R(t) are drawn from a series of Gamma distributions. Using a sliding window size, τ, of 5 days, R(t) on days 2 to 6 are assumed to be drawn from the Gamma distribution with parameters a_1 and b_1, R(t) days 3 to 7 are drawn from a Gamma distribution with parameters a_2 and b_2, and so on. In the above scenario, days 3 through 6 are in both windows and thus will be values that could be reasonably drawn from Gamma distributions with either a_1 and b_1 or a_2 and b_2. Using an assumption of Gamma distributions for the prior distribution of ω and R(t), Cori et. al. (2013)18 analytically derived a posterior distribution R(t) using fixed-size sliding windows, which has the following directly calculated (rather than inferred) mean and coefficient of variation of R(t):\nE[R(t)]=[a+ ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒I(i) ]/[1/b+∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒Λ(i) ] (Eq.6) C.V.[R(t)]=[a+ ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒I(i) ]^(-1) (Eq.7)\nThus, sliding windows with larger τ improve the stability of the estimate of R(t) over smaller τ because the coefficient of variation of R(t) decreases as number of infections increases (see Web Appendix 1 of Cori et. al., 2013).18 Sliding windows are a key feature of EpiEstim.21 There are limitations of this derived sliding window approach, articulated well in Gostic et. al., (2020)1 and summarized here. There is no posterior distribution for the expected value of incidence In the fixed size sliding window approach, τ must be explicitly defined prior to inference. Shorter τ will lead to quicker response but more variable estimates of R(t), which increases the risk of over-fitting. At the extreme, if the τ is set to 1 day, the resulting R(t) will recover exactly the infection data. In addition, there is debate in the literature about where in time the estimate of R(t) for each window should go: Gostic et. al., (2020)1 recommends using the midpoint of each sliding window rather than time t. The choice of both τ and the location of the estimate of R(t) within each window results in gaps in predictions for R(t), barring other modifications: at the end of the modeling period to account for reporting delays or time between the midpoint of τ and the end of τ, and at the beginning of the time period to allow for enough cases to materialize. Web Appendix 4 of Cori. et. al (2013) gives the following recommendation for when to calculate R(t): “Overall, we suggest starting estimating once those three criteria are fulfilled: at least after , at least after one mean serial interval, and when at least 12 cases have been observed since the beginning of the epidemic.” The default recommendation for τ is one week (7 days);18 alternatively the package APEestim integrates with EpiEstim to propose a non-default choice of τ that minimizes one-step-ahead prediction errors.22",
