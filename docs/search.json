    "text": "Overview\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, there has been a proliferation of software tools that make inference about the current state of an infectious disease outbreak.\nA widely used parameter in these tools is the effective reproductive number, \\(R(t)\\), defined in Gostic et al. (2020) as: “… the expected number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in a population where some individuals may no longer be susceptible.” \\(R(t)\\) has the following values and interpretations:\nImportantly, \\(R(t)\\) cannot be measured directly, it can only be estimated from observable variables (like reported case counts). It represents a combination of dynamic processes, including disease characteristics (e.g., infectiousness under various conditions, mode of transport) and extrinsic factors (e.g., lockdowns that reduce person-to-person contact).",

    "text": "A straightforward method of imposing structure on R(t) over time involves constraining R(t) to be drawn from the same distribution within moving time subsets, called sliding windows. We add the prefix of “fixed-size” to distinguish from methods that may adapt the size of the sliding window over time. &gt;&gt; make a destinction between deriving it and doing it by Bayesian.\nConsider the scenario where I(t) are drawn from a series of Poisson distributions and where R(t) are drawn from a series of Gamma distributions. Using a sliding window size, τ, of 5 days, R(t) on days 2 to 6 are assumed to be drawn from the Gamma distribution with parameters a_1 and b_1, R(t) days 3 to 7 are drawn from a Gamma distribution with parameters a_2 and b_2, and so on. In the above scenario, days 3 through 6 are in both windows and thus will be values that could be reasonably drawn from Gamma distributions with either a_1 and b_1 or a_2 and b_2. Using an assumption of Gamma distributions for the prior distribution of ω and R(t), Cori et. al. (2013)18 analytically derived a posterior distribution R(t) using fixed-size sliding windows, which has the following directly calculated (rather than inferred) mean and coefficient of variation of R(t):\nE[R(t)]=[a+ ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒I(i) ]/[1/b+∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒Λ(i) ] (Eq.6) C.V.[R(t)]=[a+ ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒I(i) ]^(-1) (Eq.7)\nThus, sliding windows with larger τ improve the stability of the estimate of R(t) over smaller τ because the coefficient of variation of R(t) decreases as number of infections increases (see Web Appendix 1 of Cori et. al., 2013).18 Sliding windows are a key feature of EpiEstim.21 There are limitations of this derived sliding window approach, articulated well in Gostic et. al., (2020)1 and summarized here. There is no posterior distribution for the expected value of incidence In the fixed size sliding window approach, τ must be explicitly defined prior to inference. Shorter τ will lead to quicker response but more variable estimates of R(t), which increases the risk of over-fitting. At the extreme, if the τ is set to 1 day, the resulting R(t) will recover exactly the infection data. In addition, there is debate in the literature about where in time the estimate of R(t) for each window should go: Gostic et. al., (2020)1 recommends using the midpoint of each sliding window rather than time t. The choice of both τ and the location of the estimate of R(t) within each window results in gaps in predictions for R(t), barring other modifications: at the end of the modeling period to account for reporting delays or time between the midpoint of τ and the end of τ, and at the beginning of the time period to allow for enough cases to materialize. Web Appendix 4 of Cori. et. al (2013) gives the following recommendation for when to calculate R(t): “Overall, we suggest starting estimating once those three criteria are fulfilled: at least after , at least after one mean serial interval, and when at least 12 cases have been observed since the beginning of the epidemic.” The default recommendation for τ is one week (7 days);18 alternatively the package APEestim integrates with EpiEstim to propose a non-default choice of τ that minimizes one-step-ahead prediction errors.22",

    "text": "Renewal equation estimates of R(t)\nThere are two primary classes methods of estimating R(t) from case count data that are used in most R software packages. The first class of methods assumes there is a formulaic relationship between infections and reproduction number, a relationship known as the renewal equation.10 These infections are then assumed to result in (some fraction of) the observed cases. A second class of methods involves empirically calculating a quantity that approximates the latent quantity represented by a reproduction number by fitting a curve to the case count time-series and finding the time-varying slope in log space (and then performing other transformations). Empirical calculations are discussed in detail below in our examination of ways in which R(t) is constrained over time.\nThe renewal equation relates R(t) and infections on day t, I(t), using a third parameter known as the generation interval. The generation interval, ω, is the time between infection in the infector and infection in the infectee, and assuming independence is the linear combination of incubation time, the time between infection and symptom onset in an individual, and transmission time, the time between symptom onset in the infector and infection of the infectee.11 A similar parameter to the generation interval is the serial interval, which is the time between symptom onset in the infector and symptom onset in the infectee. The serial interval and generation interval are interchangeable if the incubation time is independent from the transmission time, and some formulations of the renewal equation use generation interval. In this paper we use the generation interval ω described by a probability mass function with non-zero values from day 1 (assuming that disease incubation takes at least 1 day) to a maximum day s, i.e., the longest interval between symptom onset in infector and infectee. Taking care to note that R(t) is undefined on day 0 since there has been no transmission yet (and assuming the initial infections are I(0)), the formulation of the renewal equation is thus:\nI(t)=R(t) ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-s+1))^t▒ω(i) I(t-i) (Eq.1)\nFor brevity, we write the inner sum of (Eq.1) as:\nThe assumptions of this formulation, as per Green et. al. 2022,12 are that incident infections can be described deterministically within each window of t∈[t-s+1,t] and that the generation interval distribution does not change over the modeling time. A common reframing of the renewal equation is to equate R(t) with an exponential growth rate, r. Under specific conditions and within a small time window (t∈[t-s+1,t]), infections can be assumed to grow exponentially at a constant rate (r).12–14 Using Eq. 1 in the time window t∈[t- s+1,t] and assuming some initial infections k, R(t) for t∈[t- s+1,t] can be inferred from only r and ω: I(t)=ke^rt,t∈[t-s+1,t] (Eq.3) R(t)=[∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-s+1))^t▒〖ω(i) e^(-ri) 〗]^(-1) ,t∈[t- s+1,t] (Eq.4) Again, we will omit the writing the bounds for time in remaining formulae. A single R(t) value, say R_0, can also be put in the form of an infection attack rate, z,15 or in the final size equation,16 to estimate the proportion of all individuals that were affected by a disease with this R_0:\nz=1-exp⁡(-R_0 z) (Eq.5)\nThe attack rate function and others are implemented in the package epigrowthfit.17 The major difference between calculating R(t) from a renewal equation or an exponential growth rate equation is whether I(t) is used. If for a given time window both r and ω can be estimated independently, then R(t) can be inferred without infection data. Otherwise, infection data are needed to estimate R(t).\nUsing the renewal equation (Eq. 1) and given that I(t) and ω are known, R(t) can be solved for algebraically starting with R(t=1) and iterating forwards in time. However, this will produce highly volatile estimates of R(t) that recover the incidence curve directly. This is undesirable for several reasons: real-world infectivity likely does not vary dramatically from day to day, and real-world infection data are rarely complete, especially in an emerging epidemic, meaning that a certain amount of uncertainty must be incorporated into any estimation framework. In addition, infection incidence, I(t), are the data of interest but it is impossible to observe, so many calculations instead may use the observed reported cases, C(t), which requires some additional processing to incorporate into calculations of R(t). Therefore, a variety of constraints on R(t) are added in the inferential process: using distributions on key variables, placing restrictions on how R(t) varies through time, and with additional data sources and delay distributions. These choices dictate which estimation framework is used, which can add additional constraints.",

In this framework, there are latent or unobserved variables, e.g., R(t), that depend on observed variables, e.g., I(t) via the renewal equation, and the evolution of the unobserved variables through time can be parameterized. The auto-regressive component means that the current value of R(t) is correlated via some mechanism with R(t-1) (and potentially other past values). The packages epidemia23 and EpiNow2 contain an implementations of a random walk procedure that look generally as follows:\nf(R(t))=f(R(t-1))+N(0,σ_R) (Eq.8) σ_R ~ HalfNormal(ρ,φ) (Eq.9)\nThe random walk implies that adjacent R(t) values may be drawn from similar or even the same distribution, and would be correlated in time based on previous values. The variables ρ and φ are hyperparameters. The function f can be a transformation of R(t), e.g. in log space as in EpiNow2 to correct for the skewness of R(t), provide a variable that is more Gaussian, provide a variable that obeys the properties that we expect from R(t) (i.e., is non-negative), and aid in interpretability.

One way that a filter could be implemented is in a Hidden Markov Model.24 A simple forward-looking linear filter for R(t) in an Hidden Markov Model might look as follows, with a tuning parameter (η) to influence the amount that R(t) can vary between time-steps and a standard white noise component (ϵ):\nR(t)=R(t-1)+(η√(R(t-1) ))ϵ(t-1) (Eq.10)\nThe package EpiFilter25 implements a two-stage filtering and smoothing method for estimating R(t). A key innovation of EpiFilter is that the states of historical R(t) are constrained to a predefined set of values; this dramatically reduces calculation time. The smoothing stage refines estimates of R(t) by incorporating future incidence, in this way using all available data in estimates of historical R(t). These modeling steps help avoid R(t) instability when infections are low and instability at the beginning and (more importantly) the end of the modeling period. Another way that filtering can be implemented is across the entire R(t) time-series.\nRtEstim:28 https://dajmcdon.github.io/rtestim/articles/delay-distributions.html\n\nWe propose a discrete spline-based approach, RtEstim, that solves a convex optimization problem—Poisson trend filtering—using the proximal Newton method. It produces a locally adaptive estimator for effective reproduction number estimation with heterogeneous smoothness.28\nEpiLPS:29\nIn EpiFilter, RtEstim, and EpiLPS, each R(t) estimated in this way thus contains information about past and pending infections, e.g., for R(t=i), the smoothing step will affect R(t=i) using information from 0&lt;i≤t_max. This complicates comparisons to outputs from other methods that only use historical information to estimate R(t), e.g., estimates for R(t=i) containing only information from t&lt;i.",

    "text": "Gausian Process models\nGaussian Process models26 are a more flexible method of constraining the evolution of R(t) in time than the methods discussed thus far (in fact, a random-walk process can be thought of as a simplified case of Gaussian Process model). In Gaussian Process modeling, a family of basis functions are fit to available data, permitting inference about continuous processes without needing to a priori define where inflection points occur. The core of Gaussian Process operations is a kernel, which is used to assess the similarity between input vectors, say x and x^’. There are many options for potential kernels, and each contains different hyperparameters that are used to control the amount of smoothing that is enforced, as well as other factors. One such choice is the squared exponential kernel:\nk(x,x^’ )=α^2 exp⁡[-(x-x^’ )2/(2l2 )] (Eq.10)\nIn this kernel, the hyperparameters are the length scale, l, which controls the smoothness of the model, and the magnitude, α, which controls the range of values used in the fitting process. These parameters can be given prior distributions and fit using optimization. EpiNow2 uses contains options to use Gaussian Process models to control how R(t) in time. As one example, the relationship between first difference values of R(t) can be constrained using a zero-mean Gaussian Process model with the above kernel as the covariance function:\n    log⁡〖R(t)=log⁡R(t-1)+ GP(0,k(R(t),〖R(t〗^')))〗       (Eq.11)\n    \nThe advantage of Gaussian Process models is that R(t) is enforced to change smoothly in time using Eq.10. Limitations include complexity and computational time: Gaussian Process models have a computational complexity of O(n^3) for n observations.27 Although EpiNow2 in practice implements faster approximations of Gaussian Process models,27 in general Gaussian Process runtimes and required computational resources are considerable as compared to other methods.",

    "text": "Distributions used to define new offspring from cases\nAnother primary component of constraining R(t) is how distributions are used to define the next generation of infections, or I(t) from I(t-1).\nThe renewal equation provides a mechanism for estimating the next batch of infectees that occur due to transmission from the current round of infectors, a branching process. For time = t-1 the I(t) calculated in the renewal equation provides the expected value for a draw from a discrete distribution, the value of which represents the next generation of infectees. The discrete distribution chosen is commonly a Poisson distribution (in which the mean and variance parameter λ(t)=I(t)). Thus, using this constraint, the time-series of I(t) represents draws from a series of Poisson distributions with means of λ(t). Alternatively, a Negative Binomial distribution can be used (with a mean parameter again equal to I(t)), although this requires additionally fitting the size parameter (roughly, the spread of the distribution) to account the infectee distribution being “over-dispersed”.20\nImportantly, if additional delay distributions are included in the process of estimating R(t), the parameter that distributions are being used to estimate for the next generation may change (e.g., from I(t) to D(t), the mean value for daily reported cases calculated after applying delay distributions to I(t)).",

    "text": "Fixed sliding windows\nA straightforward method of imposing structure on R(t) over time involves constraining R(t) to be drawn from the same distribution within moving time subsets, called sliding windows. We add the prefix of “fixed-size” to distinguish from methods that may adapt the size of the sliding window over time. &gt;&gt; make a destinction between deriving it and doing it by Bayesian.\nConsider the scenario where I(t) are drawn from a series of Poisson distributions and where R(t) are drawn from a series of Gamma distributions. Using a sliding window size, τ, of 5 days, R(t) on days 2 to 6 are assumed to be drawn from the Gamma distribution with parameters a_1 and b_1, R(t) days 3 to 7 are drawn from a Gamma distribution with parameters a_2 and b_2, and so on. In the above scenario, days 3 through 6 are in both windows and thus will be values that could be reasonably drawn from Gamma distributions with either a_1 and b_1 or a_2 and b_2. Using an assumption of Gamma distributions for the prior distribution of ω and R(t), Cori et. al. (2013)18 analytically derived a posterior distribution R(t) using fixed-size sliding windows, which has the following directly calculated (rather than inferred) mean and coefficient of variation of R(t):\nE[R(t)]=[a+ ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒I(i) ]/[1/b+∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒Λ(i) ] (Eq.6) C.V.[R(t)]=[a+ ∑_(i=max⁡(1, t-τ))^t▒I(i) ]^(-1) (Eq.7)\nThus, sliding windows with larger τ improve the stability of the estimate of R(t) over smaller τ because the coefficient of variation of R(t) decreases as number of infections increases (see Web Appendix 1 of Cori et. al., 2013).18 Sliding windows are a key feature of EpiEstim.21 There are limitations of this derived sliding window approach, articulated well in Gostic et. al., (2020)1 and summarized here. There is no posterior distribution for the expected value of incidence In the fixed size sliding window approach, τ must be explicitly defined prior to inference. Shorter τ will lead to quicker response but more variable estimates of R(t), which increases the risk of over-fitting. At the extreme, if the τ is set to 1 day, the resulting R(t) will recover exactly the infection data. In addition, there is debate in the literature about where in time the estimate of R(t) for each window should go: Gostic et. al., (2020)1 recommends using the midpoint of each sliding window rather than time t. The choice of both τ and the location of the estimate of R(t) within each window results in gaps in predictions for R(t), barring other modifications: at the end of the modeling period to account for reporting delays or time between the midpoint of τ and the end of τ, and at the beginning of the time period to allow for enough cases to materialize. Web Appendix 4 of Cori. et. al (2013) gives the following recommendation for when to calculate R(t): “Overall, we suggest starting estimating once those three criteria are fulfilled: at least after , at least after one mean serial interval, and when at least 12 cases have been observed since the beginning of the epidemic.” The default recommendation for τ is one week (7 days);18 alternatively the package APEestim integrates with EpiEstim to propose a non-default choice of τ that minimizes one-step-ahead prediction errors.22",
