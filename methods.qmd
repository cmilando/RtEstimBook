# Estimating R(t) {#sec-top .unnumbered}

To aid with interpretation of package outputs, we summarize the currently used inputs, data, methods and assumptions in $R(t)$ estimation across the following categories:

&emsp;[⎘](methods_introduction.qmd#sec-top): How the relationship between $R(t)$ and infections is defined <br>
&emsp;[⎘](methods_distributions.qmd#sec-top): How $R(t)$ is constrained using distributions for key variables<br>
&emsp;[⎘](methods_time.qmd#sec-top): How $R(t)$ is constrained over time<br>
&emsp;[⎘](methods_additionaldata.qmd#sec-top): Additional data and distributions that are used to constrain $R(t)$<br>
&emsp;[⎘](methods_inference.qmd#sec-top): Inference frameworks that are used to estimate $R(t)$<br>

We also present:

&emsp;[⎘](simulation_tool.qmd#): An Rshiny application for simulation of case data and $R(t)$<br>
&emsp;[⎘](methods_research.qmd#sec-top): A list of open research questions<br>

We limit the methods discussed here to those for estimating historical to present-day $R(t)$ values using **daily case count data**, where a case can be flexibly defined as an individual with a reported positive test (either through healthcare-seeking behavior, routine surveillance, or a hospital admission). 

Other methods not discussed here include:

- inference of $R(t)$ exclusively from alternative data sources (e.g., genetic data,2 behavioral data,3 or viral loads in waste-water4), 
- calculations from compartmental, agent-based models, or network.5–7 

We also limit the discussion to packages in the statistical software R,8 which may exclude some packages in other software programs that combine many of the methodological considerations discussed below.9 

The methods discussed below and references to specific R packages are current as of December 1, 2024. We attempt to harmonize the mathematical choices between each package using terminology from each.
