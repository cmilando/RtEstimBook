### Brief description

This package implements methods described in @Li2021Bayesian for backcalculation and nowcasting and @zhou2022estimation for small area estimation using mobility data. The package uses STAN to improve computational efficiency and stability. All methods are implemented in a Bayesian framework. Currently the package does not allow the user to incorporate both mobility data and do nowcasting and account for reporting delays.

### Methods

This package contains the following methods:

@Li2021Bayesian
- Adjustment for reporting delay and nowcasting estimates
- this uses the [fixed sliding windows](methods_time.qmd#sec-fixedwindow) appraoch to estimate $R(t)$

@zhou2022estimation
- Mobility data in a hierarchical model to obtain spatially granular estimates.
- this a weekly [random walk](methods_time.qmd#sec-randomwalk) to estimate $R(t)$



### Assessment
